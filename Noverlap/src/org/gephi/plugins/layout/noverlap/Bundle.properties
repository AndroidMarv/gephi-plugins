OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=Plugin
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=No overlap: prevents the round nodes from overlapping. Optimized for big graphs. Choose speed (vs. precision), ratio (more spacing around big nodes) and margin (constant space around nodes). Great to clean a graph after another layout. NB: doesn't manage labels, for this use LabelAdjust.

OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=Just a repulsion force to prevent nodes overlap (not for the labels, though)
